    <string name="tower">The Eiffel Tower is a famous landmark located in Paris, France. It was designed by Gustave Eiffel and built in 1889 for the Universal Exposition held in Paris that year. The tower was originally intended to be a temporary structure and was almost dismantled in 1909, but it was saved and has since become an iconic symbol of Paris and France. The tower stands at 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall and was the tallest man-made structure in the world at the time of its construction. It is made of iron and consists of four legs that converge at the top, where there is a platform with a viewing deck. The tower has three levels that visitors can access, each offering a unique view of Paris.</string>
